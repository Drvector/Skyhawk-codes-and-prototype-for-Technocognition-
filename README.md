The project proposes a multi-drone system for disaster search and delivery in remote areas. A scout drone performs real-time survivor detection and geotagging, while a delivery drone drops essential supplies. Coordination is achieved via a centralised control system for efficient operations. Innovative features include thermal imaging, real-time communication, and wind-compensated delivery. Key hardware includes Pixhawk 2.4.8 flight controllers, Raspberry Pi 4B computers, FLIR thermal cameras, GPS modules, and brushless motors. Mission control utilises ArduCopter firmware and custom Python code for autonomy and vision tasks. The system's workflow covers initialisation, automated search, precision payload drop, and mission reporting. Technical challenges like GPS errors and harsh weather are tackled with sensor fusion, redundant links, and modular designs. Drones improve disaster management by enabling rapid response, reducing costs, and helping isolated victims. The solution enhances survivor safety, environmental sustainability, and rescuer coordination.
